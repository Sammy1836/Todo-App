TODO APP

In this project, I have created the basic frontend of a TODO Application using vanilla JavaScript and backend using Express. This application has features such as adding todos, deleting them. The todos get stored in `todos.json` file. This will store the todos even after we close the application.



Here are the steps to run this application.


First install node in your system

Use the `npm init` command to create a package.json file for your application.

Now install Express in the parent directory directory and save it in the dependencies list.
`npm install express`

After this install body parser
`npm install body-parser`

At the end, run the `backend.js` file using command `node backend.js`
